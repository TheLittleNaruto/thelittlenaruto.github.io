	<p align="center">
		ता एव परमथ्र्यन्ते सम्पदः सद्भिरीश याः।
		त्वद्भक्तिरससम्भोगविस्त्रम्भपरिपोषिकाः।।

	<i><p>
		"O Lord! By great Devotees, only those assets are solicited which confirms continuous manducating nectar of your devotion."
	</i></p>

	<p align="center"> Shivastotravalli 1.24:</p>

	<p align="center">
		चित्रं निसर्गतो नाथ दुःखबीजमिदं मनः।
		त्वद्भक्तिरससंसिक्तं निःश्रेयसमहाफलम्।।
	</p>

	<i><p>"O Lord! By nature itself this Mind is source of all sorrows, but it is surprising that the same mind grows the fruits of mukti when watered from the nectar of your devotion."</p></i>

	<h2 align="left">Commentaries:</h2>
	
	<p align="left"><b>Mr. Sigma Ji: </b> O  Destroyer  of  the  god  of  love,  O  Giver  of  boons,  Your  play  is  in  cremation grounds,  Your  companions  are  ghosts,  You  smear  Your  body  with  the ashes  of  burnt  bodies,  human  skulls  are  Your  garland-all  Your  conduct  is indeed  inauspicious.  But  You  promote  the  greatest  good  of  those  who remember  You.</p>	

	<p align="left"><b>MindDissolved Ji: </b>Surrendered (with love and devoted) devotee always has mind single pointed devotion. He is the one who naturally churns mind and earn knowledge with out efforts. If mind is not single pointed it become monkey who is instable and is not fixed, the one which is not stable itself  how can it provide stability. Hence mind which seems refuge in instable things how can it provide stability? ,hence is source of sorrow. But same mind when single pointedly focus on my Lord my god Shiva converts all illusions of world to the source.</p>
