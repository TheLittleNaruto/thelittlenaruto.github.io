	<p align="center">
		भवद्भक्तिमहाविद्या येषामभ्यासमागता।
		विद्याविद्योभयस्यापि त एते तत्त्ववेदिनः।।

	<i><p>"O Shankara! Who continuously practice the great knowledge which is nothing but your devotion, Only those great people will have the depth knowledge of spiritual knowledge and half-cooked knowledge."</p></i>

	<h2 align="left">Commentaries:</h2>
	
	<p align="left"><b>Akshay Ji: </b> Devotion to Lord Shiva is ultimate. Devotion means Lord Shivas words is your life and thats called devotion. Such devotion is literally the highest knowledge.</p>
	

	<p align="left"><b>MindDissolved Ji: </b>Without wisdom and devotion to My Lord My God Shiva. Knowledge is just a information. People have bookish knowledge and pretend to be knowledgeable. This people are hallow internally. True knowledge is surrendered devotion with love towards my Lord My God Shiva.</p>
