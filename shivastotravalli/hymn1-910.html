		अनन्तानन्दसरसी देवी प्रियतमा यथा।

		"O Ashutosh! Just like Goddess Para Shakti who is full of infinite bliss and is your beloved, stays with you as your integral part, similarly my never ending devotion for you stays forever within me."

	<p align="center">
		सर्व एव भवल्लाभहेतुर्भक्तिमतां विभो।
		संविन्मार्गोऽयमाह्लाददुःखमोहैस्त्रिधा स्थितः।।

	<i><p>"O omnipresent Lord! For true devotees, satvik in the form of happiness, Rajasik in the form of sorrow and Tamasik in the form of emotional attachment; i.e. this worldy life stays as resources to experience your chit-ananda form"</p></i>

	<h2 align="left">Commentaries:</h2>
	
	<p align="left"><b>Akshay ji: </b> Worldly life are resources for one to experience. Sat rajas tamas are 3 gunas of shrishti through which dehi experiences this worldly life.  Those who are unaware of this eternal satya, they think they're this 3 gunas and think objective reality is only reality and suffer.  Wrong identification.  Those who have realised they're not body and mind but a parcel of sat chit ananda for them this world is a resource for experience and sees ishwar everywhere and in everything and everyone.</p>
	
	<p align="left"><b>Mind Dissolved ji: </b> Like my Lord My God who can be easily gratified and someone who fulfils wishes instantly and is not apart from My Mother Para Shakti who is filled with infinite Bliss and love. Shiva and Shakti are in me, hence I am immersed in bhakti a union of Shiva and Shakti. True Devotee or bhakt knows and realize all the three gunas are derived from the same source of Sat-Chit-ananda a union of My Lord My God Shiva and My Mother Para Shakti remains unaffected by three gunas by their grace, as they both reside inside bhakta. </p>
