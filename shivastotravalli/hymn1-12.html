	<p align="center">
	     न ध्यायतो न जपतः स्याद्यस्याविधिपूर्वकम्।
	     एवमेव शिवाभासस्तं नुमो भक्तिशालिनम्।।
	</p>

	<i><p>"Our Salutations to those great sages who already experienced the Divine light of Lord Shiva not because of doing any japa dhyana or any 		meditation practices but by their great devotion for Parameshwara." </p></i>

	<p align="center"> Shivastotravalli 1.2:</p>

	<p align="center">
	     आत्मा मम भवद्भक्तिसुधापानयुवाऽपि सन्।
	     लोकयात्रारजोरागात्पलितैरिव धूसरः।।
	</p>

	<i><p>""O lord! it is dust of this worldly life which is making my hair color white and because of which my atma looks like old. But my soul stays young always to drink the  amrita of your devotion."</p></i>

	<h2 align="left">Commentaries:</h2>
	
	<p align="left"><b>Akshay Ji: </b> Devotion is key for realisation of Ishwara. No means or techniques can make Ishwara reveal to you but when ahamkara is destroyed with pure devotion Ishwaras grace falls on one and thus ishwara reveals himself to those who have intense bhakti.</br>God reveals himself I.e ishwara reveals himself to only pure devotional people. Not the ones who are deluded by techniques.</p>

	<p align="left">Dusts of world of Gunas moha krodha ahamkara kama have got into humans and is fixed like feviocol. As a result karma is generated. Which binds one in cycle of time. Thus oldage disease death. This has been the case for yuga yuga for humans. However when amirta of ishwara falls on to sincere devotee he at once becomes free from all worldly influence and will remain young as he transcends cycle of time.</p>

	<p align="left"><b>MindDissolved Ji: </b>Gunas are related to the body, Atma is beyond body. My body get older with time and space but Atma is beyond time and space. Hence I want to carry this surrender with devotion to which ever body I stay in.</br>Lord shiva pours it. We need to just grasp it. Let it happen, whatever IS just his grace.</p>

	<p align="left"><b>Akshay Ji: </b> ahamkara, kama, desire all are one and is connected. Controlling or crossing anyone will make others subdue. Tantras which were given by Lord Shiva gives way to control kama shakti. When that is done, rest is subdued...</br>These things will not be in memory or come from memory. Comes from Cosmic state. One can feel the difference. You cant say these from mind. It comes from Cosmos.</p>
