	<p align="center">
		भक्तानां भवदद्वैतसिद्धयै का नोपपत्तयः।
		तदसिद्धयै निकृष्टानां कानि नावरणानि वा।।
	</p>
	<i><p>
		"O Advaita Lord! Anything can become resource for devotees to prove your non-dualistic existence, whereas for those  insignificant livestock nothing works as resources who insist on disproving your non-dualistic existence."
	</i></p>

	<p align="center"> Shivastotravalli 1.16:</p>

	<p align="center">
		कदाचित्क्वापि लभ्योऽसि योगेनेतीश वञ्चना।
		अन्यथा सर्वकक्ष्यासु भासि भक्तिमतां कथम्।।
	</p>

	<i><p>"O Ishwar! Experiencing you is only possible in a certain time, in a certain place and after removing impurities of mind...; Intents like these are just illusion, Otherwise why do you appear as eternal light to your devotees in any situation be it samadhi or inversion."</p></i>

	<h2 align="left">Commentaries:</h2>
	
	<p align="left"><b>Akshay Ji: </b> who lives in denial will never get grace of Lord Shiva....But for sincere devotees, who has realized Jagat is Ishwara, for him he can easily show, everything and everyone is Ishwara.

		How? For one who has lost the sense of ego, for him no duality remains. Ekam is one. TAT vam ASI!</p>

	<p>as long as there is sankalpa of God is here only and not there, God is in temple only and not there, God can be realized only this way, can be possible only in particular time, all such illusions as long as it exist, none can realize Parama satya. Moment all sankalpas intent vanishes, Lord Shiva shines and reveals himself to such devotees.</p>
	

	<p align="left"><b>MindDissolved Ji: </b>There exist only My Lord My God Shiva, He is all form yet formless. For Surrendered devotee he can take any form as per his bhakti bhav. For non-Devotee he will remain distant horizon appearing different from self even he can sense its merging at horizon. Unless and untill non devotee become devotee as defined cannot realize the nondual nature of My Lord My God Shiva.</p>
