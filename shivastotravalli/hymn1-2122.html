	<p align="center">
		शान्तकल्लोलशीताच्छस्वादुभक्तिसुधाम्बुधौ।
		अलौकिकरसास्वादे सुस्थैः को नाम गण्यते।।
	</p>
	<i><p>
		"O Shankara! In which the waves of choices have subsided; in the ocean of peaceful, serene and  delicious devotional nectar; drinking this supernatural rasa, devotees consider others equal to them and sees no difference in every being."
	</i></p>

	<p align="center"> Shivastotravalli 1.22:</p>

	<p align="center">
		माट्टशैः किं न चव्र्येत भवद्भक्तिमहौषधिः।
		ताट्टशी भगवन्यस्या मोक्षाख्योऽनन्तरो रसः।
	</p>

	<i><p>"O Lord! Why shall, devotional medicine which destroys all the sorrows and by just drinking which one gets the Moksha, not be tasted by devotees like me who understands greatness of your devotion?"</p></i>

	<h2 align="left">Commentaries:</h2>
	
	<p align="left"><b>MindDissolved Ji: </b>It's said that to know SHIVA is to be SHIVA. When devotees are fully overwhelmed by the devotion they also become SHIVA hence they acquire all the divine qualities of my Lord my God SHIVA. They are equimonious. For them all are divine, they see no difference between them and others. They are SHIVA hence they know there only exist only one supreme BEing. The cure of all worldly ailments is realisation, Once you realize that there is no other, but only BEing. You realize that you were  never in bondages, all the bondages were illusions which were washed by the water of realization. It's duty of every Atma to surrender with live and devotion to drink the Nectar of enlightenment.</p>
