		लब्धत्वत्संपदां भक्तिमतां त्वत्पुरवासिनाम्।
		सञ्चारो लोकमार्गेऽपि स्यात्तयैव विजृम्भया।।

	<p align="center"> Shivastotravalli 1.4:</p>

	<p align="center">
		साक्षाद्भवन्मये नाथ सर्वस्मिन् भुवनान्तरे।
		किं न भक्तिमतां क्षेत्रं मन्त्रः क्वैषां न सिद्धयति।।
	</p>

	<i><p>""O lord! In this world which is made of your consciousness, which place is not shivalaya for the devotess? And in which
		place mantra chanting done won't shower your fruits of blessings to the devotees.."</p></i>

	<p align="left"><b>Akshay Ji: </b> One must become subtle or subtleness comes as a result of intense bhakti.  The more one devotes to God the more he pierces the layers of maya and attains sat chit ananda swaroopa.</p>
	

	<p align="left"><b>MindDissolved Ji: </b>Realized Surrendered Devotee experiences My Lord Shiva's nature everywhere. Shiva's nature of sat-chit-anand. Devotee is immersed in my Lord's nature everywhere, in this state  whatever Devotee speaks talks becomes mantra. He is always in state of bliss and blessed by My Lord My God Shiva.</p>
