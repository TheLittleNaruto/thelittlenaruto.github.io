	<p align="center">
		त्वमेवात्मेश सर्वस्य सर्वश्चात्मनि रागवान्।

		"O lord of freedom! You're the soul of all the beings. All the beings have that devotion to their soul unknowingly. We hail those devotees who knows this secret already."

	<p align="center"> Shivastotravalli 1.8:</p>

	<p align="center">
		नाथ वेद्यक्षये केन न दृश्योऽस्येककः स्थितः।
		वेद्यवेदकसंक्षोभेऽप्यसि भक्तैः सुदर्शनः||
	</p>

	<i><p>"O Natha! In the state/world of samAdhi, a yogi can experience your presence because reaching samAdhi state will neglect everything else; But if a person wants to feel your presence even being in this world of happiness and sorrow, Only by true devotion he can."</p></i>

	<p align="left"><b>Akshay ji: </b> Ishwara is there as the self in all beings. Ishwara is the tree, Ishwara is the humanity, Ishwara is Duryodhan, Ishwara is Arjuna, Ishwara is you, Ishwara is me, Ishwara is this Shrishti and Shristi is Ishwara. Those who through practically knows that he is not the body not the mind and who does vichara on his own existential aspect finds this SELF in him is SELF in all and this SELF is the Ishwara. Ishwara resides in all Jivas Hridya as the SELF.  Hail the devotees who have had this realization !</p>
	
	<p align="left"><b>Mind Dissolved ji: </b> Ever Free my Lord My God Shiva, you descend down in each being. All being any how knowingly or Unknowingly are devoted to this self. The realized is the one who knows this secret. He can be yogi, Yogi in state of samadhi, realizes you because he neglects everything else. But the one who wants to realized Shiva even after staying in world must surrender with devotion and love. </p>
	
	<p align="left"><b>Akshay ji: </b> A yogi can experience Shiva even with open eyes and being in world. Self realization comes by devotion only and not anyother way.... One who is extremely devoted, sees entire Cosmos as Shiva, such a Yogi can never harm any humans and he never is realm of Maya regardless of being in this world.

		Aham seed identification is root of experience of this body, induviduality. When Aham seed is uprooted by sword of devotion, what remains is only Ishwara.
		
		Such self discipline, oness in humanity, self realization alone can bring peace to entire cosmos when each humans follow it. </p>
